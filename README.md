# C++ Data Structures & Algorithms (cpp-dsa)

## Description

Personalized and custom C++ data structures and algorithms implementation, and problems.

This repo digs into fundamental data structures and algorithms. The purpose of doing this is it get practice and review common data structures and algorithms used in computer science.

In addition to practice/review, I want a centralized location that I can implement in personal projects.

## Documentation

### Data Structures

There are a handful of custom classes of common Data Structures I plan to implement. The list of currently implemented data structures are listed below.

* `LinkedList`

### Algorithms

There are a handful of custom implementations of common algorithms. The list of currently implemented algorithms are listed below.

**TODO** The following algorithms will be added

#### Search
* `binary_search`

#### Sorting
* `bubble_sort`
* `insertion_sort`
* `mergesort`
* `quicksort`
* `selection_sort`
